            <p>
                My name is Liban Ahmed, and I am currently in my second year at Iowa State University, majoring in
                Computer Science.
                I joined this Web Development class to deepen my understanding and to learn practical skills for
                building great web projects.
                My goal is to take what I have learned and create web applications that I can showcase to others!

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                    only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                    creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                    Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                    text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                    two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                    related to the project itself.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>
                    Implemented a powerful text-to-speech tool that allows users to input a URL link and obtain an audio
                    rendition of any webpage.
                    Leveraged Python for efficient webpage scraping, content extraction, and text processing, ensuring
                    accurate conversion to speech.
                    Utilized Swift to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface, enabling seamless navigation and
                    control of the app's functionalities.
                    Conducted thorough testing and debugging to identify and resolve potential issues, resulting in a
                    stable and reliable application.

                <h3>Project 3</h3>
                <p>
                    Deployed a Windows-based web server on AWS using the CDK pipeline with seamless integration of
                    Bitbucket and Bamboo for version control and continuous deployment.
                    Developed and managed a dynamic website to fetch and display data from multiple sources, ensuring a
                    simple and elegant user experience.
                    Implemented automated methods, such as scheduled tasks with PowerShell scripts and direct ADSI
                    access, to efficiently populate the SQL database with data from Active Directory.
                    Enforced strict authorization controls using Windows Authentication, ensuring a secure and
                    restricted access environment for the website.
